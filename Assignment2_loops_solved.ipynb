    "1. **Using the Notebook to Show Your Work**: You must learn to write code in the notebook... It is a core tool for data science and will make it easier to develop and document your work if you become good at using it. Writing your code in another tool and pasting it into the notebook will probably not work well: Some of you forgot to include code elsewhere, or the spacing became messed up, or it didn't run as copied.  You must be sure your code cells execute because we will test them.  So learn how to run code in the notebook cells to double check your work.\n",
    "2. **Read Directions Carefully**:  The instructions for your code are very important. If you don't follow the requirements, your application won't do as requested. Making it work correctly is part of learning to program.  If we worded something unclearly, send an e-mail to your professor."
